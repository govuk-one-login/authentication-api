# delivery-receipts-api

The Delivery Receipts API is a [callback handler](https://docs.notifications.service.gov.uk/java.html#callbacks) for consumption by Notify.  

When called by Notify the handler adds a Cloudwatch metric to track how many messages were sent by Notify, whether they were emails or SMS, and which template was used.
The output can be seen in the [Grafana - Authentication - Notify Metrics](https://g-8e26091ad7.grafana-workspace.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/d/ufjJdaR4z/authentication-notify-metrics?orgId=1) Dashboard.

At the moment the handler is deployed to both Integration and Production, but is only actually connected to Notify in Production.

## Testing the handler

The handler is not currently deployed to Build or Staging, but can be tested in Sandpit or Integration.

1. Find the `env-di-authentication-delivery-receipts-api`
1. Click on `POST` under `/notify-callback`
1. Select the 'TEST' tab
1. Go to 'Systems Manager -> Parameter Store'
1. Find the `env-notify-callback-bearer-token` and take a copy of the token
1. Back in the 'TEST' tab in API Gateway, paste in the bearer token as a header in the format `Authorization:Bearer token-value`
1. Paste the following test json payload data into the body field:
    ```
